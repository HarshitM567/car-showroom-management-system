### Problem Statement:

*Car Showroom Management System*

You are tasked with developing a *Car Showroom Management System* to manage the details of showrooms, employees, and cars. The system must provide the following functionalities:

1. *Add New Showroom*: Allow the user to add new showrooms to the system by entering the showroom details.
2. *Add New Employee*: Allow the user to add employees by entering their details and associating them with a showroom.
3. *Add New Car*: Allow the user to add new cars to the system by entering the car details.
4. *View Showroom Details*: Display the details of all showrooms added to the system.
5. *View Employee Details*: Display the details of all employees added to the system.
6. *View Car Details*: Display the details of all cars added to the system.

The system should be menu-driven and present users with a main menu from which they can choose the operation they wish to perform.

*Menu Options:*
1. Add Showrooms
2. Add Employees
3. Add Cars
4. View Showrooms
5. View Employees
6. View Cars
0. Exit

### Requirements:
- Implement an interface utility with methods getDetails() and setDetails() to handle the retrieval and storage of data for each entity (Showroom, Employee, and Car).
- Each of the entities (Showroom, Employee, Car) should have its own class and implement the utility interface.
- Use arrays to store and manage the data for showrooms, employees, and cars (up to 5 in each case).
- The program should continue running until the user chooses to exit (by entering 0).
- Include input validation to ensure the user enters valid menu options.

*Constraints:*
- The system can handle a maximum of 5 showrooms, 5 employees, and 5 cars.

Develop the system in Java using appropriate class structures, method implementations, and a user-friendly command-line interface.### Problem Statement:
